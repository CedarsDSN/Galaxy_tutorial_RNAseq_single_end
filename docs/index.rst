In this tutorial, the user will be guided through using a workflow in the Cedars-Sinai Galaxy instance. This workflow is for RNA-seq single-end analysis, and covers Primary, Secondary and Tertiary analysis. In Galaxy, there are two workflows, "RNA-seq Primary analysis single-end" which covers Primary and secondary analysis and "RNA-seq Tertiary analysis" which covers tertiary analysis.
