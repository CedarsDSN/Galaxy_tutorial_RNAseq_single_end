**Importing data**
==================

For the tertiary analysis, we can use the counts from the Primary analysis workflow (specifically from the FeatureCounts tool). Most of the RNA-seq experiments have a single factor that they want to compare, for example, treated vs. untreated. 

Before carrying out the Tertiary analysis workflow, remember to make a new history and name it "RNA-seq tertiary analysis". If you would like to import counts from the Primary analysis workflow, please use the first link below. If you haven't run the Primary analysis workflow and would like to run the Tertiary workflow with an example dataset, please use the second link below -
