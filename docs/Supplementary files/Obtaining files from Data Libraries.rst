**Obtaining files from Data Libraries**
========================================

Files can be shared with you under "Shared Data" on the top tab > "Data Libraries". When you click on Data Libraries, it will take you to a list of items which have been shared with you. 

One of the files that is shared with you and important for the "RNA-seq Primary analysis" is the adapter file named "adapters.fa". In the Data Library, you will see a library shared named "Adapters", and it's description as "CutAdapt library". 

1. Click on Adapters library and it show you the "adapter.fa" file in a new window
2. It should show you a new window with different options for this file such as "Download", "copy to History", "Auto-detect datatypes" and "Permissions"
3. You could download and then upload it to the current history by going back to the homepage and then using "Upload data" button to upload the file to the current history
4. One more easier method is to use the "copy to history" button. When you ckick it, a new textbox appears and you can select the history you want to copy it to. You could also copy it to a whole new history.
5. Click on Import and the file should appear in the history you copied it to
6. You can do this with any library that is shared with you
